To solve the given task, the qr image was downloaded and cleaned with ms paint and online tool merricx.

After the cleaned up qr codes were decoded both of which had 4 and 9 missing bytes and the decoded strings were  **http3://bp -` bew÷ec-ps.virced&app/** and **ttx3://bzZe-xybewec-0s.vircefapp-**

It was deduced then that the qr reads **https://byte-cybersec-ps.vercel.app/**

A riddle was received which signalled that the next step would be on the robots.txt of the page.

The access to the page was denied for which I changed the user agent from default to googlebot.

A code which checks for the correct flag was obtained and after reversing the tasks being performed for encryption a program for decrypting the flag was made.

The flag obtained was : Flag{3xpl0itin1g_8oundar1es_w1th_8yte}
